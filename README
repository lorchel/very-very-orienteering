Very-Very-Orienteering Map Generator
====================================

This is a very-very-orienteering map generator. If you don't know these kind of
orienteering training: Try it out! It's fun!

It works like an window or compass orienteering with rotated windows. That means
after finding the control by running in its direction, the runner has to
observe the surroundings and find out which direction is North or rather in
which direction is the next control.
 
To generate your map just export your orienteering map to an image file and use
the filename as argument. Then create some controls in the map by simply
clicking. After that rotate the controls in the other window by dragging the
connecting lines.
The maps can be saved in a tar file with the same name as the image hitting
Shift-S. Inside the tar you'll find:
   - the original map
   - a full training map with your route
   - a training map with windows around the controls
   - the very-very-orienteering map
   - and some pickled data (for loading the session later)

The session can be loaded again by giving the tar filename as argument.
Be careful, because it will be overridden when changes are saved via Shift-S.
