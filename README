Very-Very-Orienteering Map Generator
************************************

This is a Very-Very-Orienteering Map Generator. If you don't know these kind of
orienteering training: Try it out! It's fun!
Just export your orienteering map to an image file and use the filename as
argument. Then create some controls in the map by simply clicking and rotate
the controls in the other window by dragging the connecting lines. The maps
can be saved in a tar file with the same name as the image hitting Shift-S.
Inside the tar you'll find:
   - the original map
   - a full training map with your route
   - a training map with windows around the controls
   - the very-very-map basically a window map with rotated windows
   - and some pickled data (for loading the session later)

The session can be loaded again by giving the tar filename as argument.
Be careful, because it will be overridden when changes are saved via Shift-S.

Here comes a description of arguments and actions which can be performed 
in the session:

positional arguments:
  file             Filename of picture or tar file previously saved with Shift-S

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -r, --rotate     Rotate picture by 90 degrees (ignored with a tar file)
  -l, --landscape  Axes will be arranged upon each other and not next to each other

Actions which can be performed in window with original map:
   * Create new controls by simply clicking
   * Dragging control
   * Insert a control between two controls (by clicking on a line)
   * Exchange two controls by dragging one control over another control

Actions which can be performed in the window with the very-very map:
   * Redraw the map by right-click (Map is not automatically redrawn by changes
     in the other window)
   * Move start control by dragging it
   * Rotate controls by dragging the connections   
   
Actions with the sliders:
   * Change size of controls
   * Change line width of controls and lines
   * Change transparency of controls and lines
   * Change radius of windows

Actions with keys:
   * Shift-S (or big S): Save maps and the whole instance in a tar file

Actions with pylab toolbar:
   * Zooming, paning, etc. - just try
