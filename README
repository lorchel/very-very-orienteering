Very-Very-Orienteering Map Generator
************************************

This is a Very-Very-Orienteering Map Generator. If you don't know these kind of
orienteering training: Try it out! It's fun!
Just export your orienteering map to an image file and use the filename as
argument. Then create some controls in the map by simply clicking and rotate
the controls in the other window by dragging the connecting lines. The maps
can be saved in a tar file with the same name as the image hitting Shift-S.
Inside the tar you'll find:
   - the original map
   - a full training map with your route
   - a training map with windows around the controls
   - the very-very-map basically a window map with rotated windows
   - and some pickled data (for loading the session later)

The session can be loaded again by giving the tar filename as argument.
Be careful, because it will be overridden when changes are saved via Shift-S.
